Readme file for the Second Edition of Java: A Framework for program Design and Data Structures

This file system contains the source program examples from the text, organized by chapter.

Some executable byte code files are also available.

The Toolkits folder contains the support packages lamborne and ioutil.  This material includes source code, byte codes, and jar files.

Please note that the book no longer uses BreezyGUI.  This toolkit, as well as its successor, BreezySwing, are still available at http://home.wlu.edu/~lambertk/CS2Java/.

Please report any problems or errors to klambert@wlu.edu.
